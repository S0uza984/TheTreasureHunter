My first complete JAVA 2D game made for my university project.
Applying concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the game it's a simple treasure hunting which the caracther has to pick 3 keys to open the gates and conclude it, facing monsters during the journey.   
Shout out to RyiSnow for all the help and knowledge that he shared on his youtube channel
